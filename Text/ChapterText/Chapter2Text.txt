I can sense it[Beat][A][N]
The curse of the draconic power.[A][N]
[MidLeft]
Yes[Beat] I have an eye [N]
embedded in my shoulder.[N]
It gives me weird visions sometimes.[A][N]
Uh, anyway we should discuss this[N]

Are you alright?[AN]

Yes[Beat] They seem to be[N]
after dragon-blooded people.[AN]
[FarLeft]
But why?[AN]
[Left]
It could be a cultural thing.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes. Farum was founded by[N]
the dragonslayer after all.[AN]
They are very superstitious.[AN]
[FarLeft]
But going as far as invading[N]
other countries[Beat][AN]
What's their goal?[AN]
[MidRight]
Probably capturing or culling.[N]
I don't really plan to find out.[AN]
[Left]
Sounds like we should head north[N]
towards the border then.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'll stick around. They tried[N]
