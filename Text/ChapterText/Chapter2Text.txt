So you found the aloof mercenary,[N]

[Beat][A][N]
You're the same as me, right?[N]
I can sense it[Beat][A][N]
The curse of the draconic power.[A][N]
[MidLeft]
Yes[Beat] I have an eye [N]
embedded in my shoulder.[N]
It gives me weird visions sometimes.[A][N]
Uh, anyway... we should discuss this[N]
somewhere else. After the battle.[A][N]
[MidRight]
Right.[A][X]

Are you alright?[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes[Beat] They seem to be[N]
after only dragon-blooded people.[AN]
[FarLeft]
But why?[AN]
[Left]
Perhaps it's cultural.[AN]
[MidRight]
Yes. Farum was founded by[N]
the dragonslayer after all.[AN]
They are very superstitious.[AN]
[FarLeft]
But going as far as invading[N]
other countries? That's illegal! [Beat][AN]
What's their goal?[AN]
[MidRight]
Probably capturing or culling.[N]
I don't really plan to find out.[AN]
[Left]
Sounds like we should head north[N]
towards the border then.[AN]
[MidRight][ThreeLineBox]
I'll stick around. They tried[N]
to take my life. It will only be[N]
fair I take theirs.[AN]

I'm terribly sorry on [N]
my brother's behalf.[AN]

It's alright. There are all sorts[N]

Perchance there is no harm[N]

We're away from home[N]

My blade will cut down anything.[N]
Even people.[AN]
